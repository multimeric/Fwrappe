# Fwrappe - Text Wrapping around Figures in Quarto

Fwrappe (pronounced like the frappe drink, until I can work out how to pronounce *fwr*) is a **F**igure **Wrappe**r for Quarto.

## Motivation

Quarto HTML outputs don't support wrapping text around figures.
However, people often request this feature:

- <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/11053>
- <https://forum.posit.co/t/picture-and-text-side-by-side-on-quarto/147682>

It is possible to use a manual solution as described in the above issues.
The reason Fwrappe is a better option is because:

- Fwrappe is portable to both HTML and PDF (LaTeX) formats
- Fwrappe wraps entire figures instead of just images. This means that figure captions look correct
- Fwrappe provides an auto-wrap feature so you don't need to modify each figure
- You don't need to use or learn CSS and/or LaTeX yourself

## Installing

```bash
quarto add multimeric/fwrappe
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Basic Usage

First you will need to enable the filter by adding it to the filters list in your YAML metadata, **making sure you put `quarto` in the list preceding it**:
```yaml
filters:
  - quarto
  - fwrappe
```

Then, you can add the `.wrap-left` or `.wrap-right` classes to your images, to make text wrap around them.
```md

```

`.wrap-left` means "the figure will sit on the left of the page, and the text will wrap around it to the right".
This is a little confusing, I realise.

The end product will look [like this](https://multimeric.github.io/Fwrappe/example.html).

## Advanced Config

You can also customize the extension using the `fwrappe` metadata key in your documents.
This supports two different options: `auto` and `margin`.

### `margin`

> [!NOTE]
> `margin` is not currently supported for the LaTeX/PDF format. Instead, the figure will have a margin of `\intextsep` at the top, and `\columsep` at the sides

Setting `margin` to CSS length specifier such as `10px` or `2em` will let you determine the size of the margin around a text-wrapped image. For example:
```
---
fwrappe:
  margin: "200px"
---
```

[Here's an example of this obscenely large margin](https://multimeric.github.io/Fwrappe/margin.html).

You can also customize different parts of the margin [according to the CSS spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin#syntax):

> When one value is specified, it applies the same margin to all four sides.
> When two values are specified, the first margin applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right.
> When three values are specified, the first margin applies to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom.
> When four values are specified, the margins apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).

So `margin: "0px 10px 20px 30px"` will set the top, right, bottom and left margin sizes to 0, 10, 20 and 30 pixels respectively.

[Here's an example where the bottom and right margins are wide, but the top and left margins are zero](https://multimeric.github.io/Fwrappe/complex_margin.html).

### `auto`

Setting `auto` to `left` or `right` will automatically make all figures text wrap in the specified direction:

```
---
fwrappe:
  auto: "left"
---
```
You can disable this selectively by adding a `.nowrap` class to some images.
This is demonstrated [in the following example](https://multimeric.github.io/Fwrappe/example.html).
